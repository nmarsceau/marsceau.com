My approach to consuming media has been changing recently. I used to think I needed to re-watch and re-read stuff. I've played through Skyrim twice. I've re-watched The Office at least 3 times. When I was a kid, I used to read the same 5-6 books over, and over, and over.

This started changing earlier this year when I picked up the game Dishonored to play through it for a second time. The first time I played through it a couple years ago, I was absolutely hooked, and I could barely put it down. I consider it one of the best games I've ever played. And it's the kind of game that has different outcomes depending on how you play it, so it's sort of designed to be played more than once. I thought I would really enjoy playing it for a second time.

Once I got into it though, things changed. I played a couple levels, but all I could think about was how long it was going to take me to finish each one. I thought about quitting it, but now that I had started the play-through, I felt an obligation to complete it.

In many cases, I was spending all of my free time for an evening just doing *part of* a level. (Because obviously I have to do all the side quests and optional things. Otherwise, what's the point?) I was definitely enjoying parts of it, but I just couldn't shake the thought of how much time each level was taking. And even more than that, my mind kept wandering to how many more levels I had ahead of me, and how long each of those was going to be. I felt trapped by what seemed like a never-ending game.

So I finally forced myself to quit it.

At first it felt weird to stop something without finishing it, but then it kind of felt great. I felt free, and I was able to move on to other entertainment that was actually enjoyable.

The lesson I am taking away from this is that everyone is different. There are people who really enjoy revisiting media they've consumed before, often because it gives a feeling of nostalgia. Good for them! I realized that I'm not that kind of person though, and I'm glad I finally came to terms with that. For me, stuff hits very different the second time through, and the difference is very, very big.
